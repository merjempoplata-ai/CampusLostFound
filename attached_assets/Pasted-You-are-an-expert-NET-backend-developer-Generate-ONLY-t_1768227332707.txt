You are an expert .NET backend developer. Generate ONLY the backend for a university project called "Campus Lost & Found".

IMPORTANT REPLIT CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep the project small and runnable on Replit free tier.
- Do NOT generate Docker files.
- Do NOT generate a multi-project solution.
- Create a single ASP.NET Core Web API project targeting .NET 8.
- Use EF Core with SQLite by default so it runs easily on Replit.
- BUT write the code so switching to PostgreSQL is easy: read connection string from environment variable.
- Provide all files needed in a single project folder.

FUNCTIONAL SCOPE (BACKEND ONLY):
1) Authentication (JWT)
   - POST /auth/register (email, password)
   - POST /auth/login (email, password) returns JWT
   - GET /auth/me returns current user profile
   - Roles: User, Admin
   - Store passwords using ASP.NET Core PasswordHasher

2) Listings (Lost/Found)
   - Fields: id (Guid), ownerId, type (Lost/Found), title, description, category, location, eventDate, photoUrl (optional), status (Open/Claimed/Closed/Hidden), createdAt, updatedAt
   - Endpoints:
     - GET /listings (with filters: keyword, category, type, status, dateFrom, dateTo, page, pageSize)
     - POST /listings (auth required)
     - GET /listings/{id}
     - PUT /listings/{id} (owner only)
     - DELETE /listings/{id} (owner only)

3) Claims
   - Fields: id, listingId, requesterId, message, status (Pending/Accepted/Rejected), createdAt, decidedAt
   - Endpoints:
     - POST /listings/{id}/claims (auth required)
     - GET /claims/mine (auth required)
     - POST /claims/{id}/accept (listing owner only)
     - POST /claims/{id}/reject (listing owner only)

BUSINESS RULES:
- User must be authenticated to create/edit/delete listings and submit claims.
- Only listing owner can edit/delete the listing.
- Only listing owner can accept/reject claims for that listing.
- A user cannot submit a claim for their own listing.
- A listing must be Open to accept new claims.
- Prevent duplicate Pending claim by same requester for same listing (return 409 Conflict).
- When claim is accepted: claim status becomes Accepted, decidedAt set, listing status becomes Claimed.
- When claim is rejected: claim status becomes Rejected, decidedAt set, listing stays Open.

ADMIN (minimal):
- Seed one admin user on startup in Development:
  - admin@campus.local / Admin123!
- Admin endpoints:
  - POST /admin/listings/{id}/hide
  - POST /admin/listings/{id}/unhide
  - GET /admin/users
  - POST /admin/users/{id}/deactivate
  - POST /admin/users/{id}/activate

QUALITY:
- Use DTOs, do not return EF entities directly.
- Add validation and return proper HTTP codes: 400/401/403/404/409.
- Add Swagger and enable it in Development.
- Add simple global exception handling middleware.
- Keep code clean but minimal (suitable for a small academic project).

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Create the full backend project structure.
- Provide Program.cs, DbContext, Entities, DTOs, Services, and Controllers.
- Provide appsettings.json with JWT settings and connection string.
- Provide instructions at the end:
  - How to run
  - How to set environment variables on Replit
  - How to test endpoints with sample curl commands

Start now and generate the backend code.
