You are an expert .NET backend developer. Generate ONLY the backend for a university project called "Campus Lost & Found".

IMPORTANT REPLIT CONSTRAINTS:
- Must run on Replit free tier.
- Do NOT use authentication, authorization, JWT, or roles.
- Do NOT use Docker.
- Create a single ASP.NET Core Web API project targeting .NET 8.
- Use EF Core with SQLite by default (file-based DB).
- Read connection string from appsettings.json.
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Provide all code in one project folder.

PROJECT SCOPE (BACKEND ONLY, NO AUTH):

1) Listings (Lost / Found)
   Entity: Listing
   Fields:
     - id (Guid)
     - ownerName (string)   // simple replacement instead of user accounts
     - type (Lost | Found)
     - title
     - description
     - category
     - location
     - eventDate (DateTime)
     - photoUrl (nullable)
     - status (Open | Claimed | Closed | Hidden)
     - createdAt
     - updatedAt

   Endpoints:
     - GET /listings
       Supports filters:
         keyword (search title + description)
         category
         type
         status
         dateFrom
         dateTo
         page
         pageSize
     - POST /listings
     - GET /listings/{id}
     - PUT /listings/{id}
     - DELETE /listings/{id}

2) Claims
   Entity: Claim
   Fields:
     - id (Guid)
     - listingId (Guid)
     - requesterName (string)
     - message
     - status (Pending | Accepted | Rejected)
     - createdAt
     - decidedAt (nullable)

   Endpoints:
     - POST /listings/{id}/claims
     - GET /claims
     - POST /claims/{id}/accept
     - POST /claims/{id}/reject

BUSINESS RULES (STILL ENFORCED):
- A listing must be in status Open to accept new claims.
- Prevent duplicate Pending claim by same requesterName for same listing (return 409 Conflict).
- When a claim is Accepted:
    - claim status becomes Accepted
    - decidedAt is set
    - listing status becomes Claimed
- When a claim is Rejected:
    - claim status becomes Rejected
    - decidedAt is set
    - listing remains Open
- Only one claim can be Accepted per listing.

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DTOs for requests and responses.
- Do not return EF entities directly.
- Add validation (required fields, string length, date checks).
- Return proper HTTP status codes:
    200 OK
    201 Created
    400 Bad Request
    404 Not Found
    409 Conflict
- Add Swagger/OpenAPI and enable it by default.
- Add simple global exception handling middleware.
- Seed sample data (2 listings + 1 claim) on startup for development.

TECHNICAL STRUCTURE:
- Program.cs
- AppDbContext
- Entities (Listing, Claim)
- DTOs
- Services (ListingService, ClaimService)
- Controllers (ListingsController, ClaimsController)

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Generate the complete project structure and all necessary files.
- Ensure the project builds and runs without any manual fixes.
- At the end, provide:
   - How to run the app on Replit
   - Swagger URL
   - Example curl requests for each endpoint
